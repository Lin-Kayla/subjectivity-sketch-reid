## Dataset

Our proposed MaSk1K (Short for <u>Ma</u>rket-<u>Sk</u>etch-<u>1K</u>) dataset is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XjFPM1yVHpE38sSDTFgM5s9aX2r-oYRC?usp=sharing">here</a>.

Download the dataset and Market1501 attributes from <a href="https://github.com/vana77/Market-1501_Attribute.git">here</a>, and put it into your \<data_path\>.

## Guide For Market-Sketch-1K
### requirements
download the necessary dependencies using cmd.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### preprocess
```python
python preprocess.py --data_path=<data_path> --train_style <train_style> [--train_mq]
```

 - `<data_path>` should be replaced with the path to your data.
 - `<train_style>` refers to the styles you want to include in your training set. You can use any combination of styles A-F, such as B, AC, CEF, and so on.
-  `[--train_mq]` argument is optional and can be used to enable multi-query during training.

### start training
```
python train.py --train_style <train_style> --test_style <test_style> [--train_mq] [--test_mq]
```

 - `<train_style>` and `<test_style>` should be replaced with the styles you want to use for your training and testing sets, respectively. Just like in the preprocessing step, you can use any combination of styles A-F.
 - `[--train_mq]` argument is used for enabling multi-query during training, and `[--test_mq]` serves a similar purpose during testing.

### Evaluation
```python
python test.py --train_style <train_style> --test_style <test_style> --resume <model_filename> [--test-mq]
```
 - `<train_style>` should be replaced with the styles you used for your training.
 - `<test_style>` should be replaced with the styles you want to use for your testing.
 - `<model_filename>` should be the filename of your trained model.
 - `[--test_mq]` argument is used for enabling multi-query during testing.
